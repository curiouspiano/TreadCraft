# TreadCraft
This project depends on TreadmillController, a program which asynchronously controls the speed of a treadmill via a remote connection. In this case, we will use a minecraft mod to communicate with the server.

## Requirements
- Any treadmill with a controller board model MC2100L
- Raspberry Pi with a PWM signal, tested with Raspberry Pi 3
- Laptop/device to run the MC mod which communicates with the raspberry Pi over a local network

## Setup
For information on how to setup the Pi Controller, please see the designated repo.
